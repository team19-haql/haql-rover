# Simulation

The simulation uses webots. The simulation is mainly used for testing the navigation functionality. There are 2 main versions of the test environment.  `flat_test.wbt` is a mostly flat world with random objects used to test the mapping and control. `terrain.wbt` Had more advanced terrain taken from real world topology maps and was used for longer testing shown in the video below.

The package with implementation details is [webots_dev](./software/webots.md)
