# Ros2

We use the humble release of [ros2](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html). While this was in development, the newest version of ros that could be run on the [jetson](../hardware/jetson.md) was humble. To do this, we needed to run ros in the [isaac ros environment](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/hardware_setup/compute/jetson_storage.html).
